# Chatbot with NLP and TensorFlow

This repository contains a simple NLP-based chatbot built using Python, TensorFlow, TFLearn, and NLTK. The chatbot is designed to understand and respond to user queries based on predefined intents.

## Files in the Repository

- **`chatbot.py`**: The main script to build, train, and run the chatbot. It contains the entire process from data preprocessing to training the neural network and generating responses.

- **`intents.json`**: A JSON file defining various intents, patterns, and responses that the chatbot uses to interact with users. This file can be modified to add more intents or change existing ones.

- **`model.tflearn`**: The saved model file after training the neural network. It is loaded when the chatbot script is run to make predictions without retraining.

- **`training_data`**: A pickle file containing processed training data (tokenized and vectorized). This file is generated during the training process and can be used for quick retraining.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure Python is installed and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install required libraries like `nltk`, `tensorflow`, `tflearn`, and `numpy`.

2. **Prepare Data**: Update `intents.json` to include any new intents or modify existing ones.

3. **Run the Chatbot**: Execute `chatbot.py` to train the model (if not already trained) and start interacting with the chatbot.

## Customization

Modify `intents.json` and retrain the model to customize the chatbot's behavior.
